# LitData Benchmarks

This directory contains simple, ready-to-use scripts for benchmarking data loading and optimization with LitData and FFCV.

- Use the `litdata/` folder for LitData-based optimization and streaming.
- Use the `ffcv/` folder for FFCV-based dataset conversion and streaming.

You can compare both approaches for your own datasets and training pipelines.

## How to use

- See the README in each subfolder for step-by-step instructions.
- All scripts are CLI-based and easy to run.

## Why benchmarks?

Benchmarks help you:
- Measure data loading speed and efficiency
- Compare different formats and pipelines
- Choose the best setup for your training
